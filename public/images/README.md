# Images Directory

Please add the following images to this directory:

## Required Images:

1. **campaign-banner.png** (600x400px recommended)
   - The main campaign banner showing students and the gorilla mascot
   - Should be the promotional graphic for the student election campaign

2. **monkey-mascot.png** (120x120px recommended)
   - The cheerful monkey/orangutan character with orange shirt and "H" logo
   - Will be used for team member avatars

## Image Specifications:

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background preferred
- **Quality**: High resolution for retina displays
- **Optimization**: Consider using WebP format for better performance
- **Accessibility**: Ensure good contrast and clear visibility

## Usage in the Application:

- `campaign-banner.png` is used in the hero section
- `monkey-mascot.png` is used as team member avatars
- Both images are optimized with Next.js Image component

## Alternative:

If you don't have these specific images, the application will gracefully fall back to using emoji icons for team members and a placeholder for the banner.
